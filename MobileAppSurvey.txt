Mobile App Programming I
Survey

Quick note: Some of the people I surveyed had a hard time giving me an idea on the spot. For those people I also gave them
the option of telling me about an application on their phone that already attempts to solve a problem they already have,
and what they do and do not like about it. I just figured I would mention this because not everyone seems to have an easy
time coming up with a problem that can be solved by an app (possibly due to age, economic status, professional specialization,
or simply the type of person they are). Also, a couple of people were not in a setting where they were able to download and test an app,
in which case I did it for them and explained the user experience and the purpose/gist of the app.
